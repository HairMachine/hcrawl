Game Structure
**************

Your activties consume Actions, and when you hit 0 actions a survival tick happens. A survival tick depletes your food, rest and morale by one level.

You get debuffed as these levels start to drop with skill and attribute reductions. The levels are:
- Level 4: normal.
- Level 3: -5 to all skills.
- Level 2: -15 to all skills, -1 to all attibutes.
- Level 1: -25 to all skills, -5 to all attributes.
- Level 0: death.

In addition you die if any attribute hits 0.

Eating and resting are things you can do in special locations.
Those locations can also refresh morale if they are very high quality, like a fine restaurant or beautiful hotel.

Morale in general is refreshed by doing entertaining things.

You can carry rations in your inventory and replenish your food level by consuming it.
Rations are stack items like ammo and the main quality they have is how effective they are at filling you up.

You can carry camping equipment in your inventory and use it to rest, as long as there aren't any monsters around.
This isn't a great rest and doesn't increase HP like a bed, but it's better than nothing.
You can only camp in areas designated as wilderness, so not in dungeons or in towns.

The primary game loop is finding locations you can go to to get powerups.
You then go there and narrow down your search by finding more information until you get to a special location with a challenge to complete to get the powerup.

World Structure
***************

The world is full planet size like in Eldritch Horror (but isn't Earth), so brute force is not effective. Structure:

- Location consists of Encounters you generate and can sometimes return to (partially complete, world state is not being stored correctly)
- Region is several locations put together; dungeons, towns, special buildings, wilderness areas and so on.
- Cultural Area is equivalent to a nation; it's a collection of Regions. The Cultural Area shares a common culture.
- The World is a collection of Cultural Areas.

All of these are actually represented in code using the Location struct, but they are typed so the game can get some info about what each type of place is.

You move between Locations using "Doors" which are entity objects that connect the locations together.

Character building
******************

To gain power, find and power up your spells in a classic RPG style.

You gain XP for finding new things. XP is granted for a wide range of activities.
XP bonuses are granted for doing something for the first time and certain significant events give more XP than others, like seeing an opera vs eating a cheeseburger.
Bonus XP is granted if you have relevant skill points in that thing; the bonus % is = to your skill score.

You can spend your XP to level up your skill points. This is non linear, and follows a wonky curve.
The amount of XP it takes to raise a skill point drops until it reaches 50, then begins to rise sharply.
Until 50, the formula is 100 - current level to add one point (so at 0 it's 100XP, at 50 it's 50XP).
After 50, the formula is 50 + (current level-50)^2. So to raise a skill to level 100 it will cost 2550 XP (that's a huge amount in this game).

XP is spent in colleges and other learning institutions. Some are free, others require membership or payment.
Each learning institution can only teach you a certain set of skills. You will need to explore around to find sources of everything you want.

Apart from skill points, you gain power by finding items that grant you power.
All the spells and powerups are physical items you need to find in the world, and are the real way you gain power.

Clues give you one piece of information about a location. This is usually like a breadcrumb trail from the main world map into the specific location.
You should only be able to either find or understand the specific information by "zooming in" on the location; local resources can give you the next step.

- Find out what the thing is and its powers (first level)
- Cultural Area of thing
- Region where the thing is
- Individual location where the thing is
- Figure out what you need to do to get the thing (fight, talk, bribe, sneak, use your magic - whatever!)

For each item the game needs to randomly generate the above information and add it to the game world list.
When you explore, stuff is drawn from this list on the fly and flavoured with whatever text is appropriate for the current location.
These are item rolls in diablo, except you specify what you want and the game generates it based on your skills. You can just fail to find something - level up!

You need the information from the previous step to unlock later steps; so for example the info about the general location does not contain info about what the thing is.

Getting items themselves is varied and open-ended. They are almost always held by some group, so you will need to either convince them to give it to you or steal it.

Spells and Powering Up
**********************

Spells allow you to perform an individual verb on demand. These may have combat or non-combat effects, although primarily they are combat related.

Spells are found written on old books, scrolls, tablets etc. that you must hunt down, hidden in strange eldritch locations, in private collections, etc.

Once you find a spell you will need to try and decipher it. This skill check uses the appropriate school skill for the spell. Failing rolls for mutations.

Mutations are bad effects that stack up, like in DCSS. They can be cleared at holy places (works better with a higher wealth level).
Some mutations are debilitating weaknesses but some actually cause physical deformities which will disgust and frighten other people.

The higher level the spell, the more skill will be required to cast the spell.

Spells are cast to apply their effect to an item. You need to Imbue the spell into a weapon which has slots remaining for the imbuement.
Items have different numbers of slots for Imbuement; one spell per slot. Things like wands and staves have more; shotguns have none, unless they're special.

Once imbued into a weapon, you can now cast the spell on demand. This consumes your power points (max power points are determined by the POW attribute).
The amount of power points is determined by the current spell and is reduced by your spellcasting skill, rounding down.
So if a spell costs 51 power points to cast, and you have a spell casting of 20, then it will cost 41 power points to cast this spell.
With a spellcasting of 50, this would be 26 power points. With a spellcasting of 100, this would be 1 (actually every spell is 1 PP if you get there).
Power points regenerate on resting or by drinking from an Elixir.

Spells can be levelled up to increase their effects. To level up a spell, you need to find Power Crystals.
Consuming these crystals renders them inert but lets you choose one of your spells to level up.
Spells can be levelled up from 1 to 20, increasing in power or casting efficiency as they go.

Attribute Increases
*******************

There are rare artefacts and experiences that can increase your attributes.

While much simpler than spells mechanically, they are discovered in the same way; you learn of the experience, what it's said to do, then figure out how to get it.

You might gain an attribute by entering a portal to another world and touching a strange shrine that shows you the secrets of the universe.
You might do so from drinking the strange concoction of a mad scientist.
You might visit a culture and perform a special ritual with them which improves you as a person.

Wealth
******

Currency is not directly handled. Instead you have a Wealth Level which you increase over time by performing certain activities.

Your Wealth Level entitles you to perform certain actions, for example eating in a fine restaurant or renting an excellent apartment.
It also enables you to buy higher quality gear and more of it.
Due to the harshly limited inventory, it won't be broken to allow the user to choose whatever they want - it's a "loadout" more than anything.

Finding artifacts and selling them to museums or private collectors will increase your wealth level by 1. Might be worth finding a few extras!

You can gain things at a higher wealth level than you currently have. However, doing so will reduce your wealth level by the difference.
If you enter negative wealth level, you now have debt. This lowers your base reputation everywhere.
In addition you will randomly encounter debt collectors who will demand you hand over the items you are currently carrying or fight you.
These get more frequent and dangerous as you go further into debt.
